### Configuration in Cline

1. **Open Cline Settings:** Click the settings icon (⚙️) in the Cline panel.
2. **Select Provider:** Choose "Venice" from the "API Provider" dropdown.
3. **Enter API Key:** Paste your Venice API key into the "Venice API Key" field.
4. **Select Model:** Choose your desired model from the "Model" dropdown.
5. **Configure Venice Parameters:** Customize the Venice-specific options below.

#### Venice Parameters

Venice provides several configurable parameters to customize model behavior:

##### **Web Search**
Controls when the model should perform web searches:
- **Auto** (default): Let the model decide when to search
- **On**: Always enable web search capabilities
- **Off**: Disable web search entirely

##### **Include Search Results in Stream**
When web search is enabled, this option controls whether search results are included in the response stream. Enable this to see what sources the model found during web searches.

##### **Include Venice System Prompt**
Venice provides default system prompts designed for uncensored and natural responses. You can choose to:
- **Enabled**: Your prompts are appended to Venice's default system prompts
- **Disabled**: Use only your custom system prompts

##### **Reasoning Controls** (qwen3-4b and qwen3-235b only)
For reasoning-capable models, additional controls are available:

- **Strip Thinking from Response**: Remove the `<think>` tags and reasoning process from the final response, showing only conclusions
- **Disable Thinking Mode**: Turn off the step-by-step reasoning process entirely for faster responses

### Venice Parameters in Practice

When you select Venice as your provider, you'll see additional configuration options in the Cline settings panel:

1. **Web Search dropdown**: Choose between Auto/On/Off
2. **Include search results in stream**: Checkbox (only visible when web search is not "Off")
3. **Include Venice system prompt**: Checkbox for system prompt behavior
4. **Reasoning controls**: Additional checkboxes for thinking controls (only for qwen3-4b and qwen3-235b models)

These parameters are automatically saved with your workspace configuration and will be remembered across Cline sessions. The reasoning controls will only appear when you select a reasoning-capable model.

### Privacy-First Architecture

Venice's core philosophy centers on user privacy and data protection:

#### No Data Retention
Venice does not store, log, or retain any of your conversations or API requests. Your data is processed in real-time and immediately discarded.

#### Permissionless Access
No approval processes, waiting periods, or content review. Start using Venice immediately after account creation.

#### OpenAI Compatibility
Venice provides full OpenAI API compatibility, making it easy to integrate with existing workflows and tools that use OpenAI's format.

### Special Features

Venice models come with several built-in capabilities that enhance their functionality:

#### **Function Calling / Tools**
All Venice models support function calling, allowing them to use external tools and APIs. This enables:
- Web searches and real-time information retrieval
- API integrations and database queries  
- Custom function execution

#### **Web Search Integration**
All Venice models can perform real-time web searches with:
- Automatic search query generation
- Source citations and references
- Up-to-date information retrieval
- Configurable search behavior (`auto`, `on`, `off`)

#### **Vision Processing** (mistral-31-24b only)
The Mistral model provides advanced image understanding:
- Image analysis and description
- Visual question answering
- Chart and diagram interpretation
- Combined vision + web search capabilities

#### **Reasoning Mode** (qwen3-235b, qwen3-4b)
Select models offer enhanced reasoning with:
- Step-by-step problem solving
- Visible thinking process in `<think>` tags
- Configurable reasoning display options
- Advanced mathematical and logical reasoning

#### **Structured Responses**
Most Venice models support JSON schema-based structured outputs:
- Guaranteed response format compliance
- Reduced hallucination in structured data
- OpenAI-compatible `response_format` parameter
- Perfect for data extraction and API responses

#### **No Content Filtering** (venice-uncensored)
The uncensored model provides:
- Minimal content restrictions
- Creative freedom for artistic work
- Research and educational applications
- Full capability access without filtering

### Technical Implementation

Venice in Cline follows the OpenAI reasoning effort pattern for parameter handling and includes advanced capability detection that intelligently adapts tool availability based on the selected model:

#### **Automatic Capability Detection**
Cline automatically detects what each Venice model can do and adjusts the available tools accordingly:

- **Vision Tasks**: Only offered when `mistral-31-24b` is selected
- **Function Calling**: Available for all Venice models with enhanced reliability
- **Web Search**: Automatically integrated with configurable behavior
- **Reasoning Display**: Thinking controls only appear for reasoning-capable models (`qwen3-4b`, `qwen3-235b`)
- **Structured Outputs**: JSON schema support detected per model

This means you'll only see relevant options in the Cline interface based on your selected model's actual capabilities.

#### **Parameter Architecture**
Venice follows the established OpenAI pattern for parameter handling:

- **Global Settings**: Use enum types in `state.proto` for UI consistency
- **Mode-Specific Configuration**: Use string types in `models.proto` for API flexibility
- **Automatic Conversion**: Seamless conversion between enum and string types
- **Complete Persistence**: All parameters save correctly across sessions

#### **Mode-Specific Configuration**
Venice parameters are configured separately for Plan Mode and Act Mode, allowing you to:

- Use different web search settings for planning vs. execution
- Enable reasoning display in Plan Mode but strip thinking in Act Mode
- Customize Venice system prompt usage per mode
- Fine-tune model behavior for different phases of task execution

All Venice parameters automatically persist across Cline sessions and are saved per workspace.

### Advanced Features

#### **Web Search Integration**
Venice's web search goes beyond simple queries:

- **Context-Aware Searches**: Models understand when information needs to be current
- **Source Integration**: Search results are seamlessly woven into responses
- **Citation Tracking**: When enabled, see exactly what sources influenced the response
- **Multi-Step Research**: Models can perform multiple related searches automatically

#### **Reasoning Transparency**
For reasoning-capable models (qwen3-4b, qwen3-235b):

- **Visible Thinking**: See the model's step-by-step problem-solving process
- **Flexible Display**: Choose whether to show, hide, or strip reasoning from responses
- **Enhanced Accuracy**: Reasoning mode improves complex problem-solving
- **Debug Assistance**: Thinking process helps understand model decisions

#### **Privacy-First Design**
Venice's architecture ensures maximum privacy:

- **Zero Data Retention**: No conversation logs, model training, or data mining
- **Real-Time Processing**: Requests processed and immediately discarded
- **No Content Filtering**: Uncensored model available for unrestricted creative work
- **Full API Compatibility**: Drop-in replacement for OpenAI with privacy benefits

### Tips and Notes

- **Real-Time Features:** Web search and function calling work seamlessly with Cline's tool system
- **Implementation Status:** Venice provider is functionally complete and production-ready in Cline

### Troubleshooting

#### **API Key Issues**
- Ensure you copied the full API key immediately after generation
- Check that the key hasn't expired if you set an expiration date
- Verify the key has "Inference Only" permissions for regular usage

#### **Parameter Not Persisting**
- Verify that you're configuring parameters for the correct mode (Plan/Act)
- Check that the workspace settings are being saved properly
- Try refreshing the Cline interface if parameters don't appear to update

#### **Model-Specific Features**
- Reasoning controls only appear for `qwen3-4b` and `qwen3-235b`
- Vision capabilities are only available with `mistral-31-24b`
- If you don't see expected features, confirm you've selected the correct model

#### **Web Search Not Working**
- Ensure web search is set to "Auto" or "On" in the Venice parameters
- Check that your selected model supports web search (all Venice models do)
- Verify your API key has the necessary permissions for enhanced features
