# Venice AI Provider Configuration

The Venice AI provider allows Cline to connect to the Venice AI service, which offers uncensored model responses with advanced reasoning capabilities.

## Configuration

To configure the Venice AI provider, you'll need to set the following settings in your VSCode settings:

| Setting | Description | Default Value |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| `cline.veniceApiKey` | Your Venice AI API key | *(required)* |
| `cline.veniceBaseUrl` | Base URL for Venice API endpoint | `https://api.venice.ai/api/v1` |
| `cline.stripThinkingResponse` | Remove thinking process from responses | `false` |
| `cline.disableThinking` | Completely disable thinking process in responses | `false` |

### Required Configuration

1. Obtain your Venice AI API key from [Venice AI Console](https://console.venice.ai)
2. Open VSCode settings (Ctrl+, or Cmd+, on Mac)
3. Search for "Venice" in the settings search bar
4. Enter your API key in the `Cline > Venice: Api Key` field

## Provider Features

### Venice-Specific Parameters

The Venice provider supports these special parameters that can be configured:

- **Strip Thinking Response**: When enabled, removes the "thinking" portion of the response, showing only the final answer
- **Disable Thinking**: Completely disables the reasoning process, making responses faster but potentially less accurate

### Model Selection

The Venice provider currently uses the `venice-uncensored` model by default. This model offers:
- 128K context window
- Uncensored responses
- Advanced reasoning capabilities
- Support for complex instruction following

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**API Key Errors**
- Verify your API key is correctly entered in settings
- Check that your Venice AI account is active and in good standing
- Ensure you're using the correct API endpoint URL

**Connection Issues**
- Check your internet connection
- Verify the Venice API service status at [Venice Status Page](https://status.venice.ai)
- Try changing the `cline.veniceBaseUrl` if you're using a custom deployment

## Example Configuration

```json
{
  "cline.veniceApiKey": "your_venice_api_key_here",
  "cline.stripThinkingResponse": true,
  "cline.disableThinking": false
}
```

## Advanced Configuration

For advanced users, you can configure Venice to work with custom deployments by modifying the base URL:

```json
{
  "cline.veniceBaseUrl": "https://your-custom-venice-deployment.com/api/v1"
}
```

## API Compatibility

The Venice provider implements the OpenAI-compatible API interface, making it compatible with Cline's standard API handling system while providing access to Venice-specific features through the configuration options.
